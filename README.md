# Line Follower

## Overview
&emsp;Welcome to our Line Follower Project made for our Robotics class at Uni! This project involves building a self-driven car that follows a black line on a white background. The car uses sensors to detect the line and adjust its movement to stay on the desired path. This is a fundamental robotics project that combines aspects of programming, electronics, and mechanical design to create an autonomous system.

<summary><h2>Project Details</h2></summary>
&emsp;The Line Follower Project is designed to showcase the integration of sensors, actuators, and programming to achieve autonomous navigation. The primary objective is to create a car that can follow a black line on a white surface without human intervention. The project serves as an excellent introduction to robotics and is suitable for both beginners and experienced enthusiasts.

<br>&emsp;The car, as we call it, enters in a self-calibration mode when started. After the calibration mode ended, it starts following the line and races for best lap times possible.This sleek and agile autonomous vehicle is meticulously designed to elegantly navigate a black line on a white background, marrying cutting-edge technology with the aesthetics of a vintage Formula 1 car.

<summary><h2>Where did we encounter problems?</h2></summary>
  <ol>- Designing a light yet fast and well proportioned chassis.</ol>
  <ol>- Putting the screws on the chassis carefully so the chassis itself won't break.</ol>
  <ol>- Finding a PID function that suits the car perfectly.</ol>

<summary><h2>Features</h2></summary>

<ol><br><b>Self Calibration:</b> The Line Follower will enter in the self-calibration (for the QTR-8A reflectance sensor) mode once started.</ol>
<ol><b>PID Function:</b> The Line Follower is using a PID function for best results based on the weight and shape of the chassis.<br></ol>

<summary><h2>How To Use</h2></summary>

<ol><b>Get a Line-Follower Background:</b> Get your background ready (white with a black stripe shaped like a circuit).<br></ol>
<ol><b>Power On:</b> Get your car ready by plugging the battery on.<br></ol>
<ol><b>Sit back and watch:</b> Enjoy watching the "car" ripping those tyres on the lap turns and destryoing the opponents.<br></ol>
